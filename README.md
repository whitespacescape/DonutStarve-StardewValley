# DonutStarve-StardewValley
a remake combined version between Don't Starve(Keil)and Stardew Valley(ConcernedApe) 
(both are my favorite game)
# Especially, U can Switch to infinite Respawn,If U are a newbie

this game will keep open and free on

Imaging living a world where Death defines Advanture 

What If U could interact with various plants, unique NPC and powerful AI system inside the inner Game circumstance

Or even play with different person(a NPC could Think and Play with U independently) with superpower(such as Bethesda Game Feature) in a magic environment
