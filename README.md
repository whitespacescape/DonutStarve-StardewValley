# DonutStarve-StardewValley
a remake combined version between Don't Starve(Keil)and Stardew Valley(ConcernedApe) 
(both are my favorite game)

Imaging living a world where Death defines Advanture 

What If U could interact with various plants, unique NPC and powerful AI system inside the inner Game circumstance

Or even play with different person(a NPC could Think and Play with U) with superpower(such as Bethesda Game Feature) in a magic environment
